### What is this app?

This application is intended to demonstrate what I have learned about the **JQuery** library. I am building a task-managing app akin to Google Tasks that allows me to add, edit, delete, and emphasize tasks utilizing JQuery's many methods. I am also storing notes in `.md` format regarding JQuery. I am currently reading *JavaScript & JQuery: Interactive Front-end Web Development* by Jon Duckett.
